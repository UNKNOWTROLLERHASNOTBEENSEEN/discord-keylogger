# discord-keylogger
this code will send message to your discord webhook in your server which will send a keybutton
i am just putting the code so if you use for malice stuff dont blame me all i did was just putting a code for anybody to use it
also it will try to send the keybutton when the person click any button like this hello this is a test so yea
not only that but it will try to send the keybutton as fast as it can be so yea it will miss lot of keybutton i will update
i hope you enjoy my code :D
